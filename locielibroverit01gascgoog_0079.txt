Their acts were criticised by the preachers and the public (p. 44).
Dr. William Millington, oi Clare Hali, Cambridge, a Yorlrshire man with
whom Gascoigne has many sympathieS, spoke openly in his sermon at
Paul’s Cross, immediately after Pecok’s famous apology sor the non-

preaching prelates. ‘On pain of my head, Ι pledge myseli that this realm
os England will never prosper until they who approve the sentiments oi
Bishop Reginald are soundly chastised.’ This was the opinion ol many.
Layrnen and nobles said oi that Bishop Pecok, ‘Heigh-hol we are bound
by the Lord’s command to teach our families, and that bishop says that
bishops are not bound to teach their dioceses’ They were rarely pre-
sent there. 5333333, Ι)3 Moleyns, Lyhart, Lumley, Aiscough, and Booth
held offices at court, iour of thern secular sunctions, all requiring con-
stant absence irom their people. Kemp, too, the Archbishop of Yorlr,
was constantly at court or at his country house in Kent.

A custom began, says Gascoigne (pp. 132,168), in the days of
Martin V(evil times in Gascoigne's mind) and oi Eugenius IV, of getting
licenses for non-residenee on behali of their chaplains up to a certain
number. One bishop nominated as his chaplain 333 who was both rector
and vicar. But on his admission to this office, he neither resided in
the bishop's house, nor at his own cure, but gave himself up sor years
to hunting and carnal delights, saying that he had the license oi the
Pope lor these practices. Many others, in the same manner, betook them·
selves to hawking and hunting. Others, without gettinga license to hold
pluralities, get 33333333 for others, and before they present, maire the
presentee sign a legal bond to the effect that he will pay twenty marks
or more yearly to the patron or the agent. This practice, says Gascoigne,
was detected by Philip Murgan, Bishop of Ely (1426-1435), who com·-
pelled all whom he admitted to 33333333 to take oath that they had
not entered and would not enter into such bonds, and that they had not
given security that they would not sue the monks to whom a vicarage
had been appropriated lor the lull value oi the benefice.

Against these ignorant, corrupt, and shameless trafficlrers in the
endowments of the church, it was reasonable that the law should accord
to lay patrons the protection oi those writs, which have been issued since
the Constitutione oi Clarendon. ‘Alas,’ says Gascoigne (p 33), ‘how
