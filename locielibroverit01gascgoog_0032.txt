clergy. But this is improbable. Henry seems to have entered on the
French war, partly with the view ol recovering at least that which had
been lost by the rupture ol the peace os Bretigny, but quite as much
with the object ol chastising the irightlul scandals of the French Court
and ol French society. The, language in which he announces and
justifies his purposes is like that of a Puritan commander in the early
days os the Civil War, as ii he were one who was sent by God to chastise
the guilty. Severely orthodox, scrupulously- just, a model ol private
virtue, ol dauntless heroisnr, oi consummate military skill, and favoured
by unexampled good fortune, he united all the qualities which the
English admire, but have hardly ever witnessed together in their most
popular kings Henry urged on the assemblage ol the Council ol
Constance, in order to effect the union oi the distracted church.
Il his· conscience would not allow him to spare the heretic, his bene-

rise to a bishopric or a knighthood. In the end, this army was divided
between rival partisans,who sought with intermissions through the thirty
years’ war of succession, till, worn into two fragments, the relics encoun-
tered at Bosworth, and the succession was changed again.

The war with France was continued with hardly a truce sronr
August 11, 1415, when Henry the Filth sailed from Southampton, till
July 17, 1453, when Talbot and his son fell before Chatillon. It did not
exhaust the wealth os England‚ but it demoralised the English people,
and gave occasion to the civil war, which, without materially diminishing
