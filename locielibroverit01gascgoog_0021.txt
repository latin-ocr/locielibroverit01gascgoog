x PREFACE.

doubt that the publisher os ‘William os Wyrcestre' would
have searched in these volumes sor a description os society
in England during the first hals os the fifteenth century,
and would have made those extracts which Ι have col-
lected.

Ι have appended to the passages taken from the Lincoln

Manuscript certain excerpta [rom other Manuscripts, to one os
which, that os St. Augustine’s ‘De Civitate Dei: Ι have referred
above. The other volume has a curious and suggestive history.
lt contained originally three different works, bound together.
The first is a Latin Psalter, annotated by Gascoigne in his
earliest hand. The second is an account os the execution os
Scrope, written by Gascoigne himself, and is, Ι believe, the
origin os the information we have as to the particulars oi that
event. On the loose leaves os this second treatise are some
entries made by Gascoigne, which Ι have also transcribed. The

π third wasa Hebrew Psalter, which has been taken out os the

volume, probably a century ago, when the Library was putting
all its Hebrew books together. lt is to be regretted that
a rage sor uniformity has severed a volume from its place in
the book where Gascoigne had originally placed it.

This Hebrew Psalter is, Ι am informed, a Manuscript os
the fifteenth century, and was probably written in England.
The margin is written all over by Gascoigne, who was plainly
endeavouring to make himself master of the language: indeed
the MS. informs us that he began his Hebrew studies in
1431. He might have found a teacher on the spot, if the
tradition which Ι have osten heard is correct, that when the
Jews had no legal settlement in England srom the reign os
Edward the First to the' Protectorate, a little Hebrew colony
