lxii INTRODUCYION.

as great in England during the fifteenth, as they were in Germany in the
sixteenth century, and had the time been ripe lor it, Peter ‘de Monte‘s sale
os indulgences in 1440 was as provocative os secession (pp. 123-5) as that
ol Tetzel nearly eighty years afterwards. But the grievance lelt at the
acts os the Papal Court is even worse, because uninterrupted. From
John the Twenty·second (James D'Euse), one os the Avignon popes,
down to the latest years os Gascoigne’s lile, the Cardinals and other
officials ol the Court are little better than a gang of brigands, who
pillaged Europe and especially England,-who taxed the clergy with
first-fruits, claimed and occupied English beneficeS, extorted huge sums
ol money srom England, sold nulls, presentations and provisions, poisoned
popes who checked their ill doings, and murdered on salse charges ol
heresy honest preachers and genuine reformers. The dawn of Luther’s
reformation was before Gascoigne’s mind, and though he would have
abhorred schism sincerely‚ he would have thankfully welcomed an escape
from the mercenary crew which constituted the Roman Court. Is my
reader will take an example, let him read the story (p. 154) ol Prosper
Colonna, ol Louis of Luxembourg (p. 136), ol Calixtus the Third (pp.
12-13), and ol the unordained sool who, by licence os Eugenius the
F ourth, held a number ol beneficos, whose story (e. g. p. 195) is frequently
repeated.

The divines ol the fisteenth century seem to have generally held
that, in one particular at least, a General Couucil was superior to the
Pope. It could depose him. It did so by Benedict the Thirteenth,
Gregory the Twellth‚ and John the Twenty-third (Balthasar Cossa), and
the decrees ol' these Couucils were accepted. The Couucil of Constance ’
even took part in the election ol Martin the Fisth. In dealing then with
the discipline of the Church, as represented by the highest official,
a General Council could set aside an existing pontiff, and so was his
superior. But in matters ol local discipline, and in matters ol' doctrine,
the question ol the relative authority ol Pope and Couucil was more
debatable. As every one knows, the Council of Constance condemned
the doctrines ol Wiklif and ol the Hussite reformers. ‘But the Pope
misleads and is misled,’ says Gascoigne (p. 152), ‘and his grants are not
to be interpreted by the grammatical meaning of the words which they
contain.' Over and over again our author insists that his indulgences
