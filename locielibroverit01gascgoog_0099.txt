priests whom they trained, and the court made them even more depraved.
However salntly might have been the 1110 01 the king, however ardent his Ι
piety‚ however hatelul in his eyes cruelty and licentiousness were, the

age was eminently licentious and cruel. The dress 01 111011 and women
was in the last degree indecent (the lashion [p. 144] began in 1429), and
all the vices which might be expected 110111 such 1331110113 followed.
The season 01 Christmas was prolaned by ribald songs, so shocking that,
says my author, ‘an eminent person that I knew 01, 011 hearing one 01
these indecent ditties, could not get it out 01 his head, nor lorget its
images‚ and became so oppressed by the recollection that he died’ ‘The
season 01 1457 (p. 12) was very deadly‚ men dying 01 hemorrhage from
all 113113 01 the body, a judgment 01 God on account 01 the profane oaths
which were then so common, and which took 1110101111 01 swearing by the
person and limbs 01 christ?

, Among the other vices ol the age, Gascoigne comments on the grow-
ing spirit 01 litigiousness and the enormous increase 01 0011110011 lawyers.
‘Formerly (p. 108) when quarrels and squabbles arose in a parish, and
between parishioners, they were generally settled hythe wise handling
and counsel 01 the clergy, 3ηά there were lew pleas and actions got up by
lawyers. But now quarreh, dissensions, actions, and pleas are multiplied
3ηά prolonged, and thus the money, which might have gone to good 1101113,
owing to the number 01 these quarrels goes to lawyers, and advocates,
and counsel, and the number 01 these lawyers, jurists, advocates, and
pleaders is 131 greater than it need 10 be, the men who defend the bad 101
base partiality or base sear. And yet many times the cause which has
been pleaded long and with great expense gets a settlement and con·
clusion by the handling 01 the great.’ ‘Before the great plagae (p. 101),
there were lew quarrels among the people‚ and lew lawsuits, and few
lawyers in the realm 01 England‚ and lew legists in Oxlord ; and then the
English judges wore, in their hoods os office, lambskins and 1101 miniver.
It was only bishops, doctors, masters in the Universities, and lords 01
Parliament‚ who wore miniver, ermine, and grey 101.’ ‘Men keep to the
law (11. 127), not because it is the la'w, or because it is just, but because
doing thus 01 thus is the means 101 heaping up riches, and because they
love to bring loss and shame on 0111013. Thoe, they put a man charged
with an 01101100 11110 jail, in order to get ten marks 101 letting him out on
