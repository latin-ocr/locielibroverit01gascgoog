entreating him to re-commit Somerset into the hands ol two knights, who
should convey him to the Tower into lawful custody; that this petition
was refused, and that thereupon he attached Somerset, who was then in
St. Alban's, preferring that Somerset should be taken prisoner, than that
he (the Duke ol York) should be seized and slain by Somerset. No one
was spoiled of his goods with the Duke's will, but against it, as I heard
from trustworthy persons, and the Duke of Yorlc, Richard, had his
pardon or indulgence granted him by Parliament in London, along with
his adherents in the battle of St. Alban’s, for all that had been done in
that battle, and for everything occurring there, on which any man might
make plea or quarrel against theDuke oragainst his comrades.’ Somerset,
who was killed at St. Alban's on May 22, 1455, with the Earl of North·
umberland‚ and Lord Clifsord, had been released from the Tower on
Feb. 5 preceding, hythe King’s writ.

The battle of St. Alban’s, though in itscll amere skirmish, developed

bad blood enough. The Queen, aster the loss oi three among her more
zealous partisans, made up her mind to the ruin oi York, and the ad·
vantage which York gained at St. Alban’s made him equally determined
to secure himself from rislr by obtaining a recognised position in the state,
under the authority of Parliament. The King did his best to mediate
between the parties, and effected from time to time formal but hollow
reconciliations. But nothing could erase the bloodshed os St. Alban's,
and as Gascoigne is lond of saying ‘sanguis sanguinem tetigit!

The Parliament of 1455 met on July 11, and the Commons presented
Sir John Wenlok as their Speaker. They were soon prorogued to Nov.
12, for the harvest was at hand. On Nov. 19 Yorlc was again appointed
Protector, lor the King's mind was again affected, though not, it appears,
so seriously on this occasion. There is, indeed, a commission issued on
June 5, to Gilbert Keymer, Dean oi Salisbury‚ and Doctor ol Medicine,
the King's physician, and on March 10, 1456, another commission is
