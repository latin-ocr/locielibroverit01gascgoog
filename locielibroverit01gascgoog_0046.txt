A great export trade in barley was carried on between the Eastern

counties and the Flemish towns, which in return taught the Eastern
sarmers the use of hops as a means os flavouring and preserving malt
liquors, and established the distinction between ale, which was brewed
without hops, and beer which contained them. For it is remarkable
that during the whole of the sanguinary struggle between the rival
Houscs, one reads nothing oi devastations committed by either army,
except those ol Margaret’s northern troops in the winter ol 1460 and
the spring ol 1461. The record of prices in England, especially those ol
wheat and barley, gives no indication whatever that war produced scarcity.
During the whole ol the fifteenth century, the harvest was a sailure in only
one year, 1438-9. When the strile was at the hottest‚ bread and beer
¹ were abundant and cheap, sor the eost ol a labourer’s maintenance was
from ild. to 9d. a week. ln the reign ol Elizabeth, contracts sor the board
of the men in her employ were as high as 4s.6d. to 5s. for the same time.

When the Parliament os 1453 was prorogued‚ there were hopes that
Shrewsbury would re·conquer Guienne‚ and finally Normandy. But all
was lost on July 17, when the veteran and his son lell besore the lortress
ol Chatillon, and the English army was destroyed or captured. Soon
aster, Bordeaux was invested and surrendered, and every hope os re·
covering the ancient dominions os the English Kings in France was
irrevocably gone. Calais and the forts near it alone remained, and the
efforts os the year, both military and tinancial, had been wasted.

The news oi these accumulated calamities, as is most probable,
brought about the insanity which affected the King at this time. He
had gone to Clarendon in Wilts‚ when he sell into a helpless melancholia,
accompanied by utter debility and insensibility. When his malady com-
menced is not clearly stated. But ii we can inser irom Rymer, no state
paper was issued between July 27 and Dec.3, 1453. His son was born on
Oct. 23, while he was unconscious oi all that passed. He did not know
that this event had occurred, as we learn from the Paston letters, till Christ·
mas, 1454, when he recovered his reason as suddenly as he had lost it.

Public opinion had now completely veered round. The Parliament
which had met in high spirits, in a generous mood, and with a determin-
ation to make sacrifices forits loreign policy, which even acquiesced in the
administration ol Somerset, and accorded to him a temporary confidence,
