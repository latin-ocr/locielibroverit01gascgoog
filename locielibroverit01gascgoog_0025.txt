xlv PREFACE.

The special value os these extracts srom Gascoigne's Manu-
script resides in the fact, that they are singularly illustrative ol
, the darkest period in the social and political history ol England.
Other contemporary materials are, first, the Rolls ol Parliament,
which have never been sufficiently examined; next, the dry
Chronicle os Wyrcestre ; next, the pedantic dissertations of
Whetehamstede; and lastly, the Paston Letters. For the rest,
the student os history must rely on the narratives of the
Tudor annalists. ln Gascoigne we have an estimate ol English
society, made by a contemporary who had -considerable op-
portunities for forming a judgment, and possessed sufficient
searlessness in dealing with men and sacts. His words may
sometimes seem to be those os a disappointed man, often os
an angry man; but os his genuine piety, and sincere desire sor
the reformation of society, there can be no doubt.

Other manuscripts of Gascoigne, and probably the original
of these volumes, were in the Cotton Library (Otho), and
perished when the house in Little Dean’s Yard, where the
library was placed, was consumed.
