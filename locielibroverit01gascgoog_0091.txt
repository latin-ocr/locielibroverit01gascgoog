give it to anoth'er on my behalf or for love of me.⁵ And he applics td
those monks the saying of Christ, ‘All that carne before me are thieves
and robbers! The waste too is serious. ‘I have known churches which
before appropriation were worth a hundred pounds‚ but after appropria-
tion and non-residence have sunk to half that sum. Resides, there is no
end of it. Directly the monks get one church they work for another,
pretending poverty, and sic abyssus abyssum invocat? ‘What it really
means, he adds, ‘is more servants, more idlerS, more luxuries, more dishes.'
In p. 143 he draws a picture of the luxurious monh, who abuses the
opulence which piety has bestowed on his fraternity; in p. 197 he accuses
themoi trading on an extensive scale, and over and over again suggests
ι that the Pope should deprive them of their ill-gotten wealth 3ηά bestow
it to better uses. ‘The curates of the parishes have scarcely the means of
life. Nay, not satisfied with the tithes, the monks try to get the fees for
religious offices. It is known that many infants die without baptism, be·
cause parish churches have no fonts, abbeys having by license usurped the
right of forcing the inhabitants of certain parishes to bring their children
to the abbey church to be baptised, and yet they cannot* come conve-
niently by night, or at other timeS, to the abbey font'

But he is as much offended at the gross neglect of admitted duty in
these institutions. The monks used to keep chronicles; the custom has
become obsolete: they used to copy manuscripts; they have ceased to
do so: no work and more dishes is their prayer and, as faras possible,
their practice. ‘I wish (p. 73) that royal and noble founders, moved by
good confessors, would enjoin the abbots of monasteries and convents to
maintain a certain number of scribes to copy the works of holy doctors,
and of men great in knowledge, under strict penalties inflicted by king

or founder; and that the founders of monasteries should withdraw their .

benefactione aud pensions from them until they bound themselves under
the common seal of the monastery to the founder, that they would main·
tain a fixed number of such scribes for ever.' University reformers
might take a hint from this stringent rule on behalf of ‘research' which

Gascoigne commends. ‘lt is known (p. 167) that good men who have
bound wardens, deanS, and other priests to remain 3ηά reside in the
places which they have founded, are cheated, and their purpose is not
kept, because the beneficiaries reside elsewhere. The remedy for such
