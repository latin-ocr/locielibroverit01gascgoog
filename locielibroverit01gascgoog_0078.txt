to a benefice with cure of souis provided the unordained incumbent did
not undertake functions which none buta priest could lullil. So, from the
Reformation to the Restoration 3ηά the Act oi Unisonnity‚ the canonries
in cathedrals, and even parochial churches, were occupied by persons
who had not received ordination os any kind, or at least had not received
ordination at the hands of an Anglican bishop. Keymer, Dean os Salis·
bury (p. 42), was one oi those wh0‚ with the Bishop Beauchamp, the
successoros Aiscough, declared that the orthodox preachers were the
promoters of sedition and insurrection against the ecclesiastica in 1450.

The bishops owed their elevation to court intrigues, to simony, and
to bribes at the Papal court, the weakness oi the government allowing the
laws to be broken with impunity. They were ignorant and illiterata
minus habentes, as Gascoigne says, bent on accumulating wealth, which
they spent in luxury, and on corrupting their own clergy whom they had
provided with benefices, and lor whom they obtained irom the Pope
licenses os non-residence. They welcomed (p.41) the new doctrine ol
Pecok, that bishops, as bishops were not bound to preach. His brethren
said, ‘That excellent clerk and bishop will defend the practices of us '
bishops? But the public judged very differently. Nearly everyone was
heard crying out, ‘Down with the bishops who grow rich, who wish to be
called lords, to be served on bended knee, who ride about with so many
and such tine horses, and will do nothing by way of preaching to save
men's souls, ior the bishops either do not know how to preach, or omit
the duty because they cannot preach unless to preach up those ill prac-
tices ol which the bishops themselves are guilty, and do not preach good
works which the bishops do not d0, but omit, and deride, and despise
such as do them! ‘This,’ says my author, ‘was common talk about the
bishops among clergy and laity‚ and day aiter day there was more and
more stir among the people‚ and they slew the bishop os Chichester,
Adam Moleyns and the Bishop os Sarum, William Aiscough, and per-
secuted the Bishop os Chester (ie. Lichfield) one Booth, and the Bishop
os Norwich, Walter Lyhart, and many rectors and vicars in Kent‚ and
spoiled them at Samm and Hungerford.’ Certainly if there were many
such bishops as that described in p. 167, the discontent was natural.
But (p. 119) hc tells a more shocking story ol the shamelessness of one
bishop, and the promise he made to a great sinner.
