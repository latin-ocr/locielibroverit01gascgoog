Arundel and his bishops, and agreed to by the Convocation ol Can·
terbury, by which preaching without the license ol the diocesan was
inhibited. The motive is stated in the preamble of the Act to be
‘that the heretics make unlawiul conventicles and confederacieS, hold
and exercise schools, make and write books? The Act did not, I ima·
gine, trench on the privileges os either University, lor the grant of

a degree in Divinity has srom time immemorial licensed the recipient
to lecture on the Epistles in the case ol a bachelor, and on the whole
os Scripture in the case oi a Doctor, and till recently, did not require
priest's ordination sor the inferior degree in Divinity.

Gascoigne tells us that Arundel (who had been banished by Richard
lor participation in the relorms projected by the lords appellants, and
was doubtlessly much more os a politician than ol a divine), was only
a bachelor ol arts in Oxlord, that is, had merely obtained the slightest
rudiments ol an academical education. He had studied at Oriel, and
Gascoigne would have heard about him as a member os the same
college. He was not likely to know or discover what would be the
consequence ol his enactment. The heretica] preachers were not si·

William White, was very busy in disseminating the gospeller’s creed.
He had been a priest, had cast away lris orders, had married a wile, and
went about the country on his mission, chiefly in eastern England. For
a long time he escaped‚ and seemed to bear a charmed lise, sor probably
the Norsolk weavers sympathised with him, harboured and hid him. At
last he was caught in Norwich‚ tried by the bishop, condemned, handed
over to the secular arm, under the statute de heretico comburendo, and
bumt in the courtyard belore the cathedral close. When Ι happened
to be at Norwich‚ just aster the recess of 1880, Ι inspected the Corpora-
tion accounts, and lound under the year 1427 what it eost the Corporation
to burn William White, and two other hereticS, William Whaddon and
Hugh Pye. They were not the only victims oi the year. ¹

The grant os the license to preach was abused. The bishops
issued very few licenses, exacted large sums oi money sor their letters
and their seals, and made the license revocable at pleasure. ‘The
bishops do not preach, and will not suffer others to do so, except at
the entreaty os great lords. It may be proper that the unworthy should
