Harrowden, in a petition presented to the Westminster Parliament os
November, in which she gives a long and circumstantial narrative ol the
manner in which her husband had been trepanned and murdered. She
claims the right os appeal to men ol Northamptonshire only, on behall'
ol hersels, or, in the event ol her death, sor her son. Tresham dwelt in
his own country, and his widow knew that she could obtain justice lrorn
the verdict oi her neighbours. Ι have little doubt that the blow which
fell on Tresham was intended sor Parliament, and that whosoever set
the assassins on, hoped that the late of the Speaker would counsel
prudence to all constitutional reformers ior the suture.

Ifihe murderers ol Tresham intended to cow the Parliament, they

It then presented an extraordinary petition to the King, requiring
him to ordain, by authority os Parliament, that certain persons, thirty in
number, should be banished fronr the court, at a distance ol not less
than twelve miles lronr the king’s residence, under pain ol' sorleiting
