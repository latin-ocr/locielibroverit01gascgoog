August, 143 5, was great cause ol pride in English prowess, though'it lore-
shadowed Burgundy’s desertion. But the occupation ol Normandy was·
hardly oi less importante. Il N ormandy were in the hands os England,
she could prevent piracy or privateering in the numerous ports of that
duchy, and could keep in check the corsairs os Brittany, who were for
many a year alter that time the pests ol the coasting trade. Long aiter
the discovery os the New World, and that ol the Cape passage, had made

the ancient routes ol commerce less important, the retention of Calais
was supposed to be the key to England’s maritime power, and a bridle
on the Netherlands and on France. Α century aster Calais was lost,
C romwell consulted that old instinctos England which desired a fortified
port on the French and F lemish frontier, by the seizure and fortification
ol Dunkirlr, the sale os which to Louis the Fourteenth was conceived to
be a political crime and a political blunder ol the gravest kind.

The mastery over the narrow seas was not only a political security,
but in the opinion of the age, a mercantile necessity. The principal
articles ol English exportation at the time were wool and hides The·
wool trade was the chief source of English wealth, and almost the only
means by which England could acquire possession of foreign products.
It may seem strange to us now, but England was almost the only
European country from which this absolute necessary os lile, second only
to food, could be procured. A small quantity, and that, as we are told, ol
a quality which was unworkable except after mixing with English pro-
duce, was obtained by a tedious sea voyage from Spain. England in

the fifteenth century had the monopoly ol the wool market to a greater ’

extent than even the United States had of cotton belore the outbreak
ol the war between the slave-owners and the Commonwealth os the
States The sree export of wool from England meant that the looms
os Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp‚ and a hundred other thriving Flemish
townS, should go on merrily, that employment should be abundant, that
profits should accumulate, that wealth' should be diffused. Restraints
upon this article meant the decay of industry, discontent, and serious
outbreaks. The basis of those negotiations with the Low Countries,
which began with Philip Van Arteveldt, and were best illustrated, in the
days of Henry the Seventh, by the success of the Intercursus Magnus,
was English wool, its free or restrained export.
