as the private or secular estate which they or others might enjoy(p.1oo).
To Gascoigne, however, such tenets or rules os conduct were as odious
as any heresy, and in his opinion the principal causes ol corruption in w
Church and State. ‘He claimed‚' says my author, ‘to be tried by his Γ

peers, by which he did not mean the English bishops, who were not at
that time, as some thought, found to be competent, but he wanted to
have such examiners ol his books as he called his peers in scholastic
disputations, and in the popularity which heexpected to get from his
young partisans, who were noted sor unsound beliel, and reputed to be
his followers.' ,

Pecok was, it appears, an erastian, to use a phrase ol later theology.
He held that a man ought to believe that there is a Catholic Church,
but need not abide by its decisions il he has sufficient ground lor objectf
ing in his own mind against them (pp. 100, 214). But his objections
were to be esoteric, not schismatic, and to be coupled with outward con-
lormity. He would have the laity respect the motives and accept the
teachings os the clergy, that it should not break away as the Lollards

and Bible men did, but he would exact no more than conformity. But
it is again difficult to doubt that he inclined to Arian tenets, il Gascoigne' ⁴

(p. 217) is correct in ascribing the couplet to him, lor which he supplies
a rejoinder. ‘The law ol England is that the lords ol Parliament, when
accuscd of any great crime, should by twelve lords barons‚ their own
pects, be acquitted ol the crime charged against them, or be pro·
nounced guilty3 but that Bishop Pacok’ (Gascoigne is plainly punning
on his name), ‘a Welshman by birth, accuscd these holy old doctors
os salsehood, or incompleteness in their writings, but he was proved to
be their equal, neither in holy life, nor in their great learning and
miracleS, and 80, in rejecting them, he shot his arrow at the sun, and
his own arrow, by the just judgment ol God, sell on the proper head
ol that Bishop ol Chichester, Reginald Pacok.’

Still it is not probable that the bishops ol Pecok's day would have
proceeded to such lengths against their brother, who had excused them
their duties so handsomely, and in his book, ‘The Repressor ol too much
blaming ol the clergy: had published a delence ol the whole clerical
order, had he not committed some other fault. This Ι think must have
been the letter which Pecok sent in 1456 to Cannyng, the Lord Mayor
