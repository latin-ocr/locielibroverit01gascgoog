new monasteries. There were plenty ol them in existence. Land was
very valuable, and the law very jealous of monasteries acquiring land.
There was, however, one way in which an active and ambitious man could
better his fortunes or an ailing sinner could secure his forgiveness This
was by robbing the parochial clergy. The lessee for a very long term on
a very beneficial holding oi abbey lands, could make a good bargain with
the abbey; and a lrightened offender could satisfy himself that he would
get the perpetual prayers of the monks, the value ol which was not as
yet disputed, is either ol them could assist the monks in turning rectories
into vicarages-that is, in securing the principal tithes to the monastery,
and arranging that the monks should provide the services of some vicar
who would undertake the cure ol souls and the offices oi the church sor

The appropriation ol benefices to monasteries‚ colleges, capitular

have revived alter the aristocracy and caesarism of Rome had ruined
ancient culture3 for the barbarians, in destroying the remains ol it, imi·
tated and perpetuated the hatelul institutions which had wasted the
whole world. We should not even have known the history os our own
people is it had not been lor the monks, lor the chronicles ol the abbeys

are the principal materials sor the annals os England. In the days ol
violence the abbeys were nearly the only refuge3 in the days ol igno·
rance they were the only schools. Many a thriving English town owes
its existence to the sostering care ol the monks. The two English
Universities seem to have grown up obscurely under the shadow ol
ancient monasteries. It was obvious that these establishments should
be endowed with the most permanent source ol revenue,a tax on agri·
