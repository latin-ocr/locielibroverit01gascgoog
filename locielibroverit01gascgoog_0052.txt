One event, however, occurred in the autumn ol 1457, which made
a deep impression on Gascoigne’s mind, the trial and condemnation ol
Pecok. The singular circumstances which attended this trial, the lact
that this bishop is the only prelate of the pre-reformation period who
was sormally condemned lor heresy, the ambiguous and obscure character
os the charges made against him, and the happy accident that one ol the
books at least sor which he was condemned has been preserved in the
Cambridge University Library (having been printed in the Rolls' Series
by Mr. Churchill Babington)‚ and is, apart lrom any intrinsic merits
which it may possess a most interesting work, written in filteenth-century
English by an educated churchman‚ have surrounded the memory os
Pecok with a reputation which his critics and judges would have hardly
anticipated. In his search aster witnesses, Fox makes him a devout
precursor ol the Reformation‚ a pious prelate who was grievously sinned
against. Lewis. who has written his lile, but certainly has never read
Gascoigne's MS, speaks of ‘his lordship’ with similar leelings ol re·
Ι verence. Gascoigne tells us more about him than any one else, lor'
he detested him heartily, and rejoices over his condemnation with the
most orthodox satisfaction.

Reginald Pecok was by birth aWelshman, a lellow ol Oriel College,
Oxsord, who at first (p. 18) had a considerable reputation lor learning
and orthodoxy‚ who quittcd Oxsord lor the court, and graduated in
theology by special licence, or dispensation ol the regents in the Oxlord
Schools (le. the younger masters), in the year 1445, when Gascoigne
was Chancellor (pp. 26, 215). He had been made Bishop os St. Asaph
in 1444, by the influence os two well-known persons, and sorthwith took
an active part in public affairs, writing and publishing both English and
Latin books, the names of two os which, ‘De F ide’ and the ⁸ Provoker,’
have been preserved by Gascoigne. In 1447 and 1449 he preached at
Paul’s Cross to the effect that bishops were not bound to preach by
virtue ol their office; that originally the sunction ol bishop and parish
priest were one, but that since the parochial clergy had been entrusted
with local duties, they had relieved the bishops from their previous
obligations. lt appears that he published this sermon in English, and
that it made him highly popular with his episcopal brethren. He
further held that it was the bishop’s duty to be better inlormed about
