were preachers in Gascoigne’s days, our author informs us, who denounced
the vices ol the time. These were chiefly the London clergy, three oi
whom, the Rectors of St. Andrew's‚ Holbom, and All Saints', and the
Master os Whittington College, spoke out boldly. But James Say, Lord

Fiennes, took care that the King should not hear what they said, ‘for he
and others about the King would allow no one to preach before the
King unless the sermon were written and submitted to them, or unless
the preacher promised on oath that he would not preach against the
King’s household, or against the King's doings‚ or against the doings ol
his Privy‚ or to be more accurate, his depraved, Council; and so he un·
justly and unlairly, and they who sided with him, bound the Word ol
God, lest it should go forth to the public good and duty' (p. 191).

Fiennes was one ol the victims ol Jack Cade's insurrection in June
1450. In the autumn ol 1449, discontent with the governm'ent was
universal, and when the Commons met on Nov. 6, the popular opinion
pointed to Sullolk as the cause ol all the national calamities and national
disgrace. He had negotiated the marriage of Henry with the pauper
daughter of the pretended King of Sicily, who brought the king no
dowry but loss, the loss by cession of Maine and Anjou; and again by
conquest or by treachery ol Normandy and Guienne. He and those
about him had impoverishcd the king and enrichcd themselves. The
commons on meeting elected Sir John Popham Speaker. He declined
to serve, on the plea of age and infirmity‚ and they chose Thomas
Tresham, who had been Speaker in the Parliaments ol 1439, 1442,
and 1447, and was one ol the knights sor Northamptonshire.

The air os Westminster was pestilential‚ and the first session ol the

. new Parliament was held at the house os the preaching friars near

Ludgate. The House debated public affairs but there are lew records ol
their doings on the Rolls between the day os their meeting and Dec. 17,
when they were prorogued. But it must have been to this time that the
following passage ol Gascoigne refers. ‘The Parliament of England
(p. 190), continually worried by annoyances and expenses, openly said
that it would never grant the king a tax unless he first by the authority
ol Parliament resumed all that really belonged to the Crown of England,'
which the king had previously given and alienated from the Crownss’· It
is also to this Parliament that we must reler the passage (p. 189) which
