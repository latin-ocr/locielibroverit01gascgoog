times, generally with some important addition, was a half-witted follow,
who had been the playmate of a great personage (probably the King),
who received by license of Eugenius twelve prebends, an archdeaconry
worth a hundred pounds yearly, and a rectory or two, (1 cannot trace
all the preferments in Le Neve, but my readers will see the dates of
several in the Chronological Table, for it is not difficult to discover of
whom Gascoigne is speaking,) who was utterly ignorant and illiterate, was
never ordained, never visited archdeaeonry, prebend, or rectory, was daily
drunk, and was wholly incapable of managing his affairs. One layman
collected all his receipts and kept them, with an annual stipend of Aac,
three others have ,g 10 apiece yearly, another 100 shillings, while the

Seandals such as Birmingham’s pluralities were the outcome of
a general decline in the character of the English hierarchy. Birmingham
was a layman in possession of many benefices. Gascoigne mentions an·

other,a physician, married (p.43). and in possession of two deaneries two
prebends, and a great rectory, who was seldom resident in one of these
five beneficeS, and never in the others, and therefore one of those dumb
dogs of whom the prophet Isaiah speaks, This person is most probably

Dr. Keymer, Dean of Salisbury, and physician to Dulce Humphrey and
the King‚ some not over decent extracts from whose treatise ‘De Sani-

tatis Custodia’ were printed by Hearne from a MS. in the possession of

ordination was essential to the tenure of a dignity in the Church‚ or even
