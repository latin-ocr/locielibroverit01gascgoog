committee ol the Lords to wait on the King at Windsor‚ and to insorm
themselves as to the state ol his mind. It appears clearly to me that the
Peers had no conception ol the extentos the King’s derangement. With
considerate delicacy they did not appoint York as one of their number.
The committee consisted ol twelve persona, Waynflete Bishop os Win-
chester, Bourchier Bishop of Ely, who was soon Kemp's successor in the
primacy, and Bowles Bishop of Litchfield ; the Earls of Wanvick Oxsord,
and Shrewsbury‚ Viscounts Beaumont and Bourchier; the Prior os St.
John, and Lords Falconbridge, Dudley, and Stanton.

The report which these personages gave of the King's condition is
well known. They sound that his physical powers were almost gone, and
that his mind was entirely gone. They made their report on the 25th os
March. On the 27th York was appointed Protector and Defensor Regni,

remained Archbishop os Canterbury sor thirty-four years, and seems to
have acquiesced in all the changes ol the succession from the downsall ol
Henry the Sixth to the accession ol Henry the Seventh. 'The govem·
ment os Calais was taken by‘the Duke os York, and Somerset remained
in the Tower.

At Christmas, Henry recovered his physical and mental health as
completely, it appears, as he lost them, released Somerset, superseded
York, and took Calais into his own hands. It appears from Gascoigne
(p. 203) that Somerset had been committed to the Tower by the Council,
and that aster his ‘ illegal release, the Duke os York wrote to the Kingby
the hands of Wullet his consessor, while he was residing at St. Alban's,
