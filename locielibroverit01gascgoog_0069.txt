schedule ol which is annexed to the petition‚ and as, had a trial taken
place, he would assuredly have been convicted and attainted, an Act os
Parliament should be passed in proper form to declare William de la
Pole a traitor, that his blood should be pronounced corrupt, his heirs
incapable os inheritanee srom him, and his whole estate be forfeited to
the crown, except such as he might hold in trust lor others. The petition
prays that the same forfeiture should extend to his chattels, save moneys
paid by a certain date, and gilts made by the Duke to the University ol
Oxlord. The petition concludes by charging Pole, in addition to his other
misdeeds, with having contrived and effected the arrest, imprisonment‚
and final destruction of the Duke ol Gloueester, with having abridged the
lives oi the royal princes, and with having estranged lords who were near
in their relationship lrom the King. The petition was indeed rejected,
but its presentation is a proos ol how proiound was the dissatislaction

liamentary tactics os Tresham and Oldhall, ol Thorpe and Cherleton,
successive Speakers oi the House, are on the same lines with those
adopted by Eliot and Pym, Hyde and Hampded. The action ol the
House is a genuine reflex ol public opinion ; and they who can read
between the lines of the Rolls ol Parliament can without any violent
effort recall the motives, the speech, and the acts os those who vainly
but honestly endeavoured to arrest the progress ol those impulses
which were hunying the nation into civil war. Unlortunately lor the
statesman ol the filteenth century, there was no remedy to be found
against the two cankers ol the time, the total corruption of the chureh,
and the utter lawlessness ol' the aristocracy. To pull down one bad
man, like Sullolk, was merely to make room lor another bad man, like
Somerset· To ruin and degrade a mischievous and conceited prelate
like Pecok‚ was to make a place sor an equally mischievous, more im·
moral, and infinitely more ignorant person, like Nevil. Pecok indeed
