named dues. The fourth grant is that copon archers‚ to be provided
rateably by the counties 3ηά towns, 3ηά paid sixpence'a day for six
months3 a schedule being annexed to the act, in which the proportion is
set forth to the extent of 13,000, which the King declared to be sufficient.
On the announcement of these particulam, the King in person, and Kemp
the Chaucellor‚ thanked the Commons for ‘their faithfulness‚ their con·
sideration, 3ηά their immense generosity.’ The House then adjourned for
the Easter holidays, and was ordered to meet again on April 25.

When they met again, Somerset, the Captain of Calais, laid his
accounts before them, and prayed 3 settlement of outstanding obliga·
tinus, both for himself and his predecessor the Dulce of Buckingham.
The Commons direct that the arrears and the current charges should be
liquidated from the Customs, and the Speaker‚ Thorpe‚ on behalf of the
Commons, expedites the payment of the grants made on March 28, i.e.
Wednesday before Easter, ¹4 53. The King again thanlred the Commons
warmly, 3ηά on July 2, remitting ‘the nobles to their recreations and de-
lights, the commons to the harvest,’ prorogued Parliament to Nov. ια,
when it was to meet at Reading.

1 have gone through these expedients at some length, partly because
they are an instructive illustration of medieval finance, partly because
they specify the resources which the country possessed at the time.
There was, the times considered, abundance of wealth in England at the
period immediately preceding the outbrealr of civil war. The fifteenth
century was a period of singularly unbroken agricultural prosperity, of
plentiful harvests, of high wages, of accumulated opulence. Land which
3 century before yielded in rent a return of ten per cent. on the purchase
money, now yielded five or less. Farmers were gradually acquiring free·
hold estates 3ηά becoming yeomen, were the progenitors of the small
gentry who played so conspicuous a part in English History two cen-
turies later. In the universal passion for acquiring land commons were
enclosed, often by usurpation, and men of free estate became the pur·
chasers of copyhold, thus giving stability and a higher position to those
‘estates which the law books still affected to call base or precarious.
The tenants oi these base sees resisted even the payment of customary
rents, and successfully demanding arbitration between themselves 3ηά
'their lords‚ succeeded in reducing and permanently fixing their liabilities.
