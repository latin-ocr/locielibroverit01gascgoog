‘hlodem sinners say (p. 123l, “I do not care what and how many sins
1 commit in God's sight, because 1 can easily and speedily get a plenary
remission granted me by the Pope, whose writing and grant 1 have
bought lor fourpence, or sixpence, or for a game 01 tennis;‘’ for they
who sell letters 01 indulgences go up and down the country and give
such a letter, now for twopence, now for a good drink of wine or beer,
sometimes as a trager at tennis if they lose, sometimes for the hire of
a harlot‚ and sometimes as a personal favour. Peter de Monte, who in
the year 1440 collected much money by indulgences issued by Pope
EugeniuS, as he was leaving England and went on board ship, told Doctor

Brescia. γ There were other people besides Gascoigne who suspected these

on papal indulgenceS, and declared that fora thousand years after Christ,
such instruments as had become usual had never been seen.

But the seandal which affected Gascoigne more than anything else
was that which was always before his eyes, the possession 01 the arch-
deaconry of Oxford‚ under papal provision‚ and through the agency 01 Ι
