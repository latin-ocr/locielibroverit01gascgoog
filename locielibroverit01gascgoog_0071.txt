lx INTRODUCTION.

only one figure rn the scene to which English history affords no parallel,
that os the blameless and helpless king

Again,' m order to read between the lines of these invaluable frag-
ments oi Gascoigne'‘s Liber Ventatum and to see how, with naturally
clerical leanings, he was alive to the present difficulties and impending
s sorrows os his own generation, one must know the concontration of English
social lile in the fifteenth century from its highest and widest mani·
festations in Parliament. The personality ol Gascoigne is that of a well-
connected, fairly-opulent English priest, who was stored with the learning
os his age, was honoured by his contemporaries, was orthodox in his
beliels, but unsparing in his condemnation oi those who did not reach
what he believed to be the standard ol public and private duty. Had
hc set his heart on wealth, he would have done better as an honest
tailor. He has friends: Robert Thwaites, master of Baliol, and
William Grey, oi the same College, afterwards Bishop ol Ely, are
students like himself. His admiration sor some ol the London and
Cambridge clergy is hearty. The pious knight, Sir Thomas Cumber·
worth, who believed in the holiness os Sempe, and who gave (p. 149)
lands and tenements to divers parishes in order to make up the loss
which the incumbents suffered, by the greedy monks and their impro-
priations‚ is, to Gascoigne, the type os a high-minded and worthy
layman. But he has no patience with the worldly bishops, the licentious
courtiers, the gluttonous monks, and the corrupt Oxford Congregation.
The world os Christendom is saved by the valour ol John Hunniades.
The Turk is beaten back from the walls oi Belgrade; the Papal Court is
even obliged to consess that the Hungarian hero was right in forbidding
the exportation oi the nation's wealth by the pardon·mongers who carne
there; God himself wrought a special miracle by John Capistran0, the
monk who led the Christian host to its unequal combat with Waldewach,

but the English prelates with Bourchier at their head (p. 48), the
successoros the slothsul Kemp and the licentious Stafsord, gave no
thanksgiving sor the deliverance ol Christendom, for the first arrest
ol the great wave which seemed likely to again engulf the West in
a savage barbarism. Oxford, indeed, had the grace to give thanks,
to sing solemn chants, to make a general procession, with a Te Deum .
