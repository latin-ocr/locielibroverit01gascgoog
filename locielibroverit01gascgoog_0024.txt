PREFACE. xiii

compared the copy with the original Manuscript That some
errors of transcription have crept in is possible, though Ι have
taken all pains to avoid this inconvenience. Greater difficulties
arise from the errors of the scribes who had been selected to
write out Gascoigne's noteS, but whose labours were only par·
tially revised. There remain other difficulties in Gascoigne's
own style, which is generally involved, and frequently ungram-
matical. Ι have only in rare cases altered a word, and then¹
only because the error was manifest.

It seemed desirable to retain the original spelling through-
out, for historical reasons. To this rule Ι have made only one
exception. There are no diphthongs used in the original, and
perhaps it would have been better if Ι had, in my copy, followed
the author in this particular. But in commencing the work it
struck me that if Ι did so, Ι should import needless ambiguities
in the transcript‚ and consequently‚ Ι continued the practice with
which Ι have commenced my copy. The same exact system of
transcription hasbeen employed with the Arabic and Roman
numerals, which are used indifferently, and are sometimes
treated as adjectives, sometimes written as in our own day.
Arabic numerals which appear, as far as my researches inform
me, to have been introduced in accounts as early as the latter
end ol the thirteenth century, do not prevail over Roman
”numerals till the beginning of the seventeenth. The use of
Roman figures necessitated a clumsy system of calculation,
which is well known to those who are familiar with old
accountS, but must have been sufficiently convenient for the
auditos receipt and expenditure. But it is singular that so
obvious a convenience as decimal notation made such very
slow progress
