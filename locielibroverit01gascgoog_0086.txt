library, not in that oi the students.

To goa little beyond the bounds of Gascoigne’s lile, no one who
studies the history oi the fifteenth century, especially that period
between 1449-1461, srom which so many important constitutional
principles can be, as they have been, derived, can fail ol being struck
with the singular sacility with which the prelates ol the age accom-
modated themselves to the times, without exception. Mr. Anything,
or Mr. Facing·both·ways, in Bunyan's allegory, were prentices to them.
Every English revolution, except that os the Royal Successiou, has had
its episcopal partisans. Most oi the English hierarchy were sacriticed
at the Conquest. William the Second, Henry, Stephen‚ had their '
friends and loes on the episcopal bench. Henry the Second was in the
same position. John had to face a true-patriot in Stephen Langton,
whom the Pope put on him, a man whose career and conduct must have
surprised the Pope as much as it daunted John. Henry the Third had
his allies among the prelateS, and so had Simon de Montfort. Edward
had a struggle with them and quelled them. His miserable, soolish,
disreputable son had a soe in Orleton and a friend in Stapledon. Merks,
il wc can trust the story, strove to maintain the rights of Richard the
Second, even when his cause was quite hopeless as Arundel aided Henry.

But no man among the bishops oi Henry’s time, even those who owed
everything to him—men like Lyhart and Wainfleet, Chedworth, Car-
penter‚ Booth, Low—appears to have helped him by word or deed.
Bourchier had been made archbishop during Henry's insanity3 Nevil

during the first captivity os Henry, i. e. aster St. Alban's. But Bourchier
served every change with uniiorm pliancy. He crowned Edward the
Fourth in 1461. He had no scruple in welcoming the restoration oi
Henry in 1471. He congratulated the conqueror ol Barnet and
Tewkesbury. He acknowledged the title os Edward the Fiith, accepted
the usurper’s claims with alacrity, and wheedled Elizabeth Woodvile out
oi her other boy, who was with her in sanctuary. The last public act os
his long and contemptible career—sor he was primate sor thirty-three
years-was to crown the founder ol the house ol Tudor. Among the
odious prelates oi the fifteenth century this sellish, sordid, heartless,

time-serving churchruan is the least respectable. Gascoigne formed
