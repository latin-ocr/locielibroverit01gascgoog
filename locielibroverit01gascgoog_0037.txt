Henry the Fifth, was a saint. He was not a monh, as some have
said, lor the English monle ol the filteenth century was, as a rule, a
gross and greedy voluptuary, whom no one respected, but no one yet
saw how to get decently rid ol, except piecemeal, as lor example when
Waynllete was founding his college at Oxlord, and Alcock his at Cam-
bridge. Nor did Henry allect asceticism, or pretend to dispense with
natural affections. He loved his mother, he was warm·hearted to all his
kinslolk, he loaded the man who was afterwards his rival with benehts‚
he heaped favours on the Neviles, who owed everything to his dynasty,
and on the Mowbrays, who had been the hereditary ioes os his family, as
well as on the Beausorts, the Percies, and the Poles, who were his para·
sites and his ruin. He was gentle and affectionate to the imperious
woman whose fortunes were tied to his own, whose mad lury destroyed
his dynasty by putting an end for ever at Coventry to all hopes ol
reconciliation between the laetioris, whose northern army, by its
devastations‚ set all Eastern England and London against the house
os Lancaster. He bore no mallee to the savage old pedagogue War-

He inherited a war, in which indeed he took no part, except as part ol a
pageant. The war which made others rich made him a pauper. Sir
John Fastolle and Lord Cromwell collected gigantic fortunes lrom their
spoils and from lucrative trade. The opulence ol the houses ol Nevile,
Beausort‚ Holland, Pole‚ Stafford, and the rest, was prodigious. The
riches of the English nobles were a matter os wonder even to those who
had been familiar with the wealth ol the house ol Burgundy, and ol the
Flemish burghers But the English King‚ on whom and on whose
revenue the cost ol all the administration was imposed‚ was lar poorer
than most os the nobles who supported his throne, and had good reason
lor supporting it, but were quarrelling over the succession3 while an
infinite mob (we can read them in the exceptions to the acts of resump-
tion) was squabbling over the plunder ol the Crown, which was really the
plunder ol the nation. (Rot. Parl. iv.)

Matters came to a crisis in 1450. The debts ol the Crown, mainly
lor the maintenance ol the King’s household‚ amounted to A372‚0oo,
