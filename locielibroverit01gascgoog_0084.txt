be excluded srom the office ol the preacher, but why should all be
suspended, and be exposed to the extortions or the caprices ol the
diocesan? Man should not impose silence on all doctors and bishops
because several ol both kinds are heretics. But,' adds my author,
‘the judgment ol God carne on the archbishop. His throat was choked
so that he could neither swallow nor cough; and thus he, who by his
own tongue had stopped the word ol God, had his tongue stopped

when he was anxious above all things to speak. The silencing of the
preachers was a matter to murmur at, having been done in order to
suspend a lew heretics, but the bishops did not or could not preach
themselves, and were angry (p. 35) when men said “Such and such
a doctor preaches well, though no bishop, but our bishop neither can

The corruption and pride ol the flitmum-century bishops is illus·

said, “li you will, sir, that l should speak, 1 will mention what seem to me
to be the four causes ol the lact.” The king gladly gave him leave.
“One cause,” said the clerk, “ was, that once God showed by sorne special
sign who was worthier than other men by reason ol his wisdom and
holy lise to be made bishop, and thereupon God made miracles on behall

persons are chosen by earthly persons and by you kings to be bishops as
pleases you, and just the same miracles which you kings d0, the bishops
