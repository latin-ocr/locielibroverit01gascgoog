DECOLLATIO RICARDI SCROPE, ARCH. EBORUM.

Nora

[ΙΝ early life, Gascoigne seems to have written an account ol the execution
os Scrope, archbishop oi York, who had been compromised in the rebellion oi
the Percies Gascoigne was anative oi Hunslet, now a part ol the town ol
Leeds, and sor many reasons must have been familiar with the details ol' an
event which was as shocking as it was novel; for it was unprecedeuted, and,
in the opinion of the time, was sacrilegious The MS, which appears to be in
Gascoigne's handwriting, is to be found, with certain other documents, in MSS.
Bodley, Auctar iv. 5. The account given by Gascoigne was closely followed by
Clement of Maidstone‚ though there are some variations in the narratives of the
two. The first page of Gascoigne’s MS. has long been lost, sor the pagination
of the book, which is continuous, is at least as old as the early part of the seven-
teenth century. The portion between brackets is taken from Clement os Maid-
stone‚ and is probably almost identical with what was contained in the first page
ol Gascoigne's work. The volume, which belonged to Gascoigne, contains two
other entries in his later hand Another passage is taken from MS. os S. Augus·
tine's Civitas Dei (Bodley MSS. 198, which belonged to Grostete, and, as we are
informed in a note, was annotated by that prelate), and contains an account of the
oll'er made to Gascoigne of the rectory ol S. Peter‘s, Cornhill, which was then,
as now, in the patronage ol the Corporation of Londoo]
