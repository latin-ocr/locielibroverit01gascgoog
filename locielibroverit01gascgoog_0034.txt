Lancaster, during the time of the King’s insanity. Between the death
ol Gloucester and the birth os Edward, the possible rivals sor the throne,
should it become vacant, were the niece os the Duke ol' Somerset‚ whose
family, it appears, had been legitimated without reservation‚ the nearest
representative of the house ol Lancaster, and the Duke ol' York, who
had assuredly never sorgotten his superior claim to the throne, and was
looked on by all parties as first princeos the blood.

The episode ol Joan of Arc was vexatious, and led to the raising
ol the siege of Orleans, and the occupation os Rheims. But the English
held possession ol Paris till April, 1436, and os Normandy and Guienne
sor a much longer period. But in lact, no army ol English, however
numerous and however well appointed, could have kept France in sub-
jection. It would have been necessary to garrison every town with
English troops, at least in other than the hereditary dominions os the
Plantagenet kings, and to have secured the constant services os a strong
ally on the mainland. For a time the English had such an ally in
the Duke of Burgundy. But when the alliance was broken by the raid
on Calais, and the death oi Bedsord, the hope ol occupying France was

was the' retention ol Normandy and Guienne, the connecting link ol
which was Anjou and Maine.

The possession ol N ormandy was, according to the pollcy ol Eng-

the control of all commerce by sea. This is shown with great clear-
'ness and detail in that remarkable political tract, published in the
Rolls’ Series, among other political songs and ballads ol the lourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, by the late Mr. Wright, under the title of
‘A Libel ol English Policy.‘ The whole mercantile marine of Europe
was engaged in coasting along France to the Low Countries‚ with the
exception of that-already almost lost, owing to the decline ol the Greek
empne—which passed up the Danube, and that which was carried on the
highway of the Rhine. The occupation ol two strongly lortified ports
at the narrowest part ol the Channel, at Dover and Calais, was the key
of the position, and the repulse of the Flemings srom besore Calais, in
