mayor or bailiffs of the cities and towns, to put into execution the
decrees oi the bishop's court. Universal suffrage was granted in
the counties, and the language of the Commons was bold and even
, minatory. No English sovereign‚ perhaps, whose lise ended naturally,
had a more troubled and unhappy reign. He was born in the same
year as the cousin whom he deposed, and died before he reached
the 47th oi his age. The attitude taken towards him, in what Gas-
coigne calls the letters patent of N orthumberland, Edmund Mortimer,
and Bardoll‚ is that oi charging him with perjuries, calling on him to
resign his kingdom to the right line, claiming that the lords oi the
kingdom should be judged by their pects, that the king's council
should be reformed, that the sheriffs should be sreely elected, and that

which he had gained and! kept his crown‚ the mean concessions by
which he had disarmed or conciliated opposition, were forgotten in
the splendid career of his son. Henry of Monmouth was twelve years

at Shrewsbury against the Percies. Perhaps the stories os his wild
youth are exaggerations, suggested by the stern mbrality os his riper
years Never has an English king been more thoroughly popular than
Henry the Fisth. A conspiracy against him in the beginning of his
reign was put down without difficulty, and with little scandal. Itis
stated that Henry was induced to undertake the conquest oi F rance,
or at least the recovery ol Normandy and Guienne, at the instance
of Chichele, the newly-appointed Archbishop os Canterbury, in order
to ward off a threatened attack on the temporalities of the regular
