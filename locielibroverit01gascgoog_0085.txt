require more perfect works than any private rule duee, and thus any
prolessed monk could be elected to a bishopric, and the people, who
were thus entreated, accepted episcopal duties sor the salvation ol souis
reluctantly‚ and thereupon were translated aster death by reason of their
miracles. Again, holy bishops os old, reflecting on the episcopal duties
put on them, did not wish to be translated from bishopric to bishopric
sor the sake os larger revenues, but now they are translated srom bishopric
to bishopric in their lives, and so do not deserve to be translated by the
evidence ol miracles aster their death. Again, iu these days, men buy
their translations and their bishoprics so dearly in their lives, that they
are not worth translating alter their deaths, nor that God should do
miraculous works by their merits.” And the clerk said to the king,
‘·' You, sir, know one man who gave two thousand marks to a great lord
to get translated srom his bishopric to an archbishopric.'’ The king
was pleased with the answer ol that clerk.’

‘Bishops used, as one can see in the lile ol St. Cuthbert, to talk
humbly and familiarly with their subjects‚ and every day to give any one
ol their subjects an audience‚ if he wished to converse with his bishop.
Lately a poor man came to the servant os an archbishop, the sonos

the archbishop does not give audience in his own person to his subjects
as his predecessor did.” The servant ol the archbishop answered. “My
lord‚ the present archbishop. was not bred in the same way that his
predecessor was bred,'' meaning by this that his lord archbishop, who
was so strange and distant to his subjecta was the son oi a lord, and his
predecessor, who had been archbishop besore him, was the son ol
a common man (Chichele's father was said to have been a tailor). The
poor man answered the archbishop’s servant, “The present archbishop
and his predecessor were certainly of very different breeding, but it is
clear sor all that, that his predecessor was the better man, and more
uselul to his subjecte and their souls and the whole diocese.”' The ideal
bishop, to Gascoigne’s mind. was Grosteste-learned, pious, firm, wise.
But the great Bishop oi Lincoln, as my author knew, was os very humble
origin. The iriars minor oi Oxiord, whom in the early days oi their
activity and saintliness, as it was thought, Grosteste protected and
assisted, (a century or more later Wiklii thought very differently oi
