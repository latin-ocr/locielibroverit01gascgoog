the bishop, ‘I will not act according to your bull, sor Ι believe that the
Pope never gave it in words, 3ηά I know that he cannot grant it in lact,
ior the power given him by Christ is that he should bind what man may
rightly bind, 3ηά bind and loose without man’s consent any human act,
but only as it accords with the increase of God’s worship and the true
sasety os souis. No manos sane mind could accept your contention‚
that any one who has a papal license to the effect, shall be absolved
by any competent priest.’

But the most striking illustration ol the bishop in Gascoigne’s age is
to be found in a story which he tells oi De la Bere, Bishop oi St David's
(p. 35). This man had been Henry’s almoner, had been made Dean oi
Wells by papal provision (p. 200), and had caused infinite scaudal by the
