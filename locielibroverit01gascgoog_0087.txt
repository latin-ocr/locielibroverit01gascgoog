a lair judgment os him, even though he condemned and degraded
the hatelul Pecok.

The last conclusion which the Council ol Constance condemned in
Wiklii's doctrines is very sweeping and very startling. ‘Omnes religiones
indifferenter derivantur de Diabolo.' By this generality Wiklif meant
the monks‚ in whom he discovered much evil and no good. They were
the Pope's army of occupation in England, and Wiklif hated them as an
Englishman ol the sourteenth century hated the Avignon popeS, and as a
Reformer of the sixteenth who had corneto the conclusion that the Pope
was Antichrist would hate the Pope’s police. Gascoigne is loyal to the
Pope, though he has great misgivingS, buthe loves the monks little more
than W iklis did. The fifteenth century was not sriendly to the religious
orders. Henry the Fil‘th‚ a very devout prince, did what his great-
grandlather, with an equally good reason for it, did not venture on
doing, for he suppressed the alien priories. The example was followed.
Alcock suppressed a nunnery at Cambridge for the purpose of founding
a college there, and Waynflete contrived to do the same by Selborne, at
least. The wealthy prior of Selbome was certainly-I have read his
household accounts—a very luxurious and probably a very scandalous
person, who surrendered on the understanding that a round annuity
should be paid him in consideration of his vested interests. But I do
not remember to have read of the foundation ol more than one new
monastery in the filteenth century. This was the splendid and wealthy
house ol Sion, which Henry the Sixth endowed with part oi that which
remained to him of the alien pn'ories, the residue being devoted to
Eton and King’s (or St. Nicholas’) College‚ Cambridge. The occasion
ol the foundation of Sion was the cultus ol a new and a royal saint,
St. Bridget ol Sweden‚ iu whose holiness, revelations‚ and miracles
Gascoigne is a firm believer‚ e. g. pp. 14o‚156, 165, 169.

Wealthy men in the fifteenth century founded schools‚ colleges,

⁸and chantries, established collegiate churches, os which Gascoigne highly
approves, provided the clergy in them keep residence, and built magni·
licent churches. The architecture of the age has lost all grace, has none
ol that poetry in stone which an older and more imaginative generation

possessed in iulness, but, according to the character ol the society which
produced it, is massive and business-like. But no one cared to sound
