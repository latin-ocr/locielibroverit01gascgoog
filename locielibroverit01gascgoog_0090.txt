in Cambridge, depended mainly for their revenucs on tithes now entirely
secularised.

Every one has read of the ingenuity with which the monlrs sought
to evade the various statutes of mortmain. It is said that English law
owes many of its technicalities and fictions to the devices of the monlrs
who were always inventive and always bafiled. lt is clear from Gas-
coigne that they had very much their own way with impropriations. lf
a landowner wished to improve his estate by an addition, the readiest
way was to exchange with the monastery for the great tithes of a benefice
which was in his patronagc. If a benefactor wished to found a collegiate
church‚ or endowa cathedral with a number of new prebenda the great
tithes of parishcs were the most obvious source, one which got him the
prayers of those whom he had endowed‚ at little or no expense to himself.
If the building funds of a cathedral fell short, if the offerings of the faith-
ful, and collections like those made for Yon< (pr) were insufficient, the
tithes of a rectory could be made into a fund. lf men believed still in
the superior efficacy of monastic prayers the monles would rather accept
tithes than land. The settlement of the former was easy, that of the
latter perilous, for the heir of the grantor, or falling him, the crown, was
too much interested under the mortmain laws to allow their rights in
land to bc set aside on account of the grantor‘s soul.

To judge from the frequent and bitter complaints of Gascoigne, this

impropriation must have gone on very extensively in his days. He quotes
many cases, and dwells indignantly on the practice. A secular priest
himself, he believed sincerely in the parochial system, and in the benefit
bestowed on a parish by the residenee of a conscientious‚ opulent, hos-
pitable, and benevolent rector. Under the significant heading of ‘Furtum’
(pp. rod-r 15), he writes at length on the evil which he saw done by im-
propriations. ‘l knew,' he says (p. 1 12), ‘a rector, who, from the income of

a single church which he held, maintained at school and the University
twenty youths whom he educated for the priesthood. lfou tell me,' he
observes (p. 113), ‘that these impropriators pray for the parishioners cf
these impoverished churcheS, and this, they say. does ruore good to them
than the prayers of one rector. But pray loolr at the reason of things. lt
