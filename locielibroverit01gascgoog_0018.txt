PREFACE. vll

Veritatum' (pp. 12, 129), is a collection os passages illustrating
or explaining a number of wordS, in a rude alphabetical order,
lrom ‘Absolucio' to ‘Virginitas’ Occasionally an article is
inserted out of its place. Sometimes as in the largest ex·
tract which l have made, the position ol the passage is due
to thc leading word in the heading, i.e. ‘Flumina’ (p. 53). In
the vast majority ol cases, the interpretation or comment which
the author makes is founded on, or confirmed by,a quotation
from some one ol the Latin fathers especially SS. Jcromc,
Augustino and Gregory, and the English divine, Grosteste.
But the author quotes a very large number os authorities,
and must have been possessed, as wc know to be the fact
from other evidence, ol a very considerable library sor the
times, During his liletime he gave many books to Oriel‚
Balliol, Lincoln‚ and Durham Colleges

l have read the Manuscript through; but, except to one
who might desire to know what were the studies of a fifteenth
century divine, there is little to interest any reader in the
merely theologica] part os the work. The authors with whom
Gascoigne was familiar have not bcen lost. The books
which he studied are, many of them, still in existence. The
volume from which l have quoted the extract which comes
last in the present work, and is represented in faesimilc on
the title-page, once belonged to Grosteste, and is full os that
prelate’s marginal notes, It subsequently became Gascoigne’s
property, and was given by him, as an entry on the first
page in his own hand informs us, to Durham College. Aster
the Reformation and the suppression ol Durham, now the site
of Trinity College, it came into the possession of a member

or Gloucester Hall, who gave it to the Bodleian Library.
