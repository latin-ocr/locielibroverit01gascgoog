and the arrears owing lor the purveyance os provisions was an intolerable
grievance. The necessary expenses ol the household were &4000
a·year, irrespective os extraordinary charges The ‘livelihood’ ol the
King had sunk to A5,000 a·year. The House ol Commoris attempted
to grapple with the difficulty. They appropriated, from various sources
ol the hereditary revenue, as yet I presume untouched, 265582 185· 7ld.
sor the payment os those who supplied provisions td the household‚ and
put the proceeds into the hands of the Steward, Treasurer, and Comp-
troller of the Household sor the time being. They added to this sum
all the revenues os the Duchy ol Lancaster, saving the Queen’s jointure,
the sees, wages, reparatione costs and expenses os the Duchy, a large
exception. They sortified their resolution by drawing up the limitation in
the ordinary form of a modern act, By the King‚ with the advice and assent
ol the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commoris in Parliament,

debts on the part os the Crown. There can be no doubt that the old
arrears were swept away into the unknown, and that the deficit on the
experiment of 1450 followed thern. The House os Commoris, in the
Parliaments of 1450 and 1453, was as incapable of checking and con·
troiling the charges ol the Administration as the House os Commons is
in 1880. The difference is that men wondered and were rebellious in
the former period. But the art of the financier is so subtle in our time,
that men wonder and are patiently impoverished.

The taxation of the fifteenth century was, except for the import
duties, which were insignificant, and the export duties on wool and hides,
which a modern Chancellor os the Exchequer might well envy, all direct.
The Crown had a right of preemption os all products and all serviceS,
and as a tole, it did not abuse the power. In the many thousands ol
accounts which 1 have read, Ι have seldom discovered any evidence oi
wrong doing on the part of the King’s purveyors, as long as the accounts
display the debits and credits of nobles and os wealthy corporations. It

is true that the Despencers in Edward the Second's time ventured on
