was a man os learning, who might have held his own despite his sus·
picious theology, il he had not meddled with politics on his own
account. Nevil was a youth, who was not old enough to be con-
secrated, even by the most pliant ol popes, to his see (p.16),and yet
he lelt himself able in Pecolr’s humiliation to twit him (p. 2¹3) with
his contempt lor the holy doctors. 1 cannot but think that there is
not a little sarcasm in Pecok's reply: ‘I regret that Ι wrote so, lor Ι
did not look sufficiently to the circumstances.’

Again, the events ol these six years, compared with the earlier
days os the Long Parliament, and the earlier action ol the Convention
Parliament, not to go later down, are confirmatory oi the lact that
lor centuries the solution os political difficulties has been manageable
by a well-ordered and patriotic Parliament. To my mind, the par-

parliamentary control. And 1 venture on saying that there is no
single principle ol government and finance, no serious issue between
the administration and the nation, which was not, il one reads the
facts aright, present in the constitution which Fortescue lauded, and
Tresham and his lellows guarded. The experience ol the fifteenth
century statesman was narrow3 he had to create his precedents, and
to define his procedure, but he was resolved on maintaining the in-
stitutions which he had inherited. Alter the vices ol the two most
powerlul lactors in the state, the Church and the nobility, made ruin
os those labours which would have given England a genuine Parliament‚
well lortified by needsul privileges, and yet strong in that modest sell-
respect which assists men more than anything else to wise speech and

counsel, alter despotism seemed the only reluge from anarchy‚ and
England went back two centuries the successors ol the t'ilteenth century
statesmen cherished their traditions‚ and in good time revived them for
opportune action. The arraignment os Sufiolk by Tresham is as in-

teresting a study as the impeachment ol Strafford by Pym. There is
