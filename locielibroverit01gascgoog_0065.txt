eminent doctors os the age, were traduced before the King and Council,
when the real causes were the wrongs os the kingdom, the enormous
taxes, the total sailure of justice both in civil and ecclesiastical courts, so
that il the preachers had been silent, the stones, i.e. the people‚ would
have cried out.‘

Hitherto, all action which had been taken by the Commons or by
the insurgents, by Parliament which fairly expressed the national senti·
ment, and by associations which professed to do so irregularly, had been
on the side oi the reforming party. Suffolk had been expelled srom the
royal councils‚ and dispatched by an agency only less informal than that
os the London mob, who hewed his horse in pieces and slaughtered his
stable grooms. It would have been infinitely better ior Henry's house-
the malcontents would never have touched him—is he had let Suffolk
take the trial which Lords and Commons were equally anxious to bring
him to. There is nothing more touching in English history than the
reverence which all men felt sor Henry. Had it not been sor the sweet·
ness oi his character, his gentle piety‚ his unswerving conscientiousness,
the events oi 1461 would have been anticipated in 1450.

William Tresham had been four times Speaker os the House oi
Commons. Only one other man had been honoured so osten with the
confidence os the House. He had, as in duty bound, led the attack on
suffolk. The precedent, though the purpose oi Parliament was baffled
by the Kings lenity or the Queen's will, was ol prodigious importance.
Alter the lapse ol' two generations, the Commoris had reasserted their
right to impeach an oll'ending minister, whose acts could not perhaps be
exaggerated into treason, but were sar more mischievous than the crimes
oi any ordinary traitor. The session oi 1450 was, on constitutional
grounds, the most important that had hitherto been held in the history
of the English Parliament. The two houses were obviously at one, and
it was plain that if the two worked together they could strike terror into
bad ministers. Sir John Popham‚ who had been fust elected, declined
the office on the ground of age and infirmity, but more probably from
timidity, and Tresham had consented to serve again. l do not conclude
that he was revolutionary, still less Yorkist in his tendencies. I see no
reason to believe that in the sense ol hostility to Henry and Henry’s
family, there was a Yorkist party. lt is probable that he was a loyal
