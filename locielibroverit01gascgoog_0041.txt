The importance ol salt in the economy oi medieval life was very great.
From November to May, the mass of the English people lived on salted
provisions. On every fast day salted fish was the customary diet of
those who had anything more than bread to eat. The trade in salted
fish was a very important and lucrative employment. It was the princi·
pal means oi preserving sood in winter, and was the first condiment at all
times. It was in the period 1 write about entirely derived stom solar
evaporation. A wet summer raised the price os salt sar more than it
did that of wheat‚ and in ordinary times the price os salt away from the
sea closely corresponds, the above exception taken, to the price of wheat‚
It could be procured abundantly and cheaply srom the salterns oi
Western F rance. Long after the severance ol Guienne from England
was an accomplished lact, English monarchs, in their treaties with
France‚ demanded the free export os Gascon salt as a condition os
their negotiations. (Corps Diplomatique‚ Tom. iv, pars 1. 1527).

The wrath os the English when they coupled the marriage of Mar-
garet oi Anjou with the loss oi Maine and Anjou, and the subsequent
loss os Normandy and Guienne, knew no bounds. ‘That Queen Margaret,'
says Gascoigne (p. 205), ‘with whom the kingdom did not get the worth
os ten marks (the value oi his own prebend), did much in England aster
her husband, King oi England, fell into a notorious lunacy, and what will
comens the Queen’s acts in the year of the Lord 1457, God knows!
‘The King of England, Henry the Sixth (p. 221) gave under his Great
Seal, Anjou and Maine, to the sather of the Queen Margaret, and to
the heirs os Queen Margaret's father, him who called himself King of
Sicily, and had neither obedience nor revenue srom that kingdom,
which was subject to the then King of Arragon, and the aforesaid
Queen begged this gift from the King of England sor her father by
the agency os the Duke os Suffolk and his wise, who had promised
their aid in the request; and we are told that the Duke os Lorraine
. swore to the Duke and Duchess (of Suffolk) that he would bring about
a final peace between France and England, is the King of England
would cede the provinces, as he did by his scal, giving possession of
thern by the hands of Adam de MoleynS, then Bishop ol Chichester.
What the end will be (p. 204) God knows, who knows everything. May
His will be done, asin heaven so in earth! There were Englishmen,
