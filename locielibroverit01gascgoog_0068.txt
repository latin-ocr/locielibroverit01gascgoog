memory will be accursed lor ever,’ describes as ‘indignus episcopus Ces-
triae' (p. 4o); and again (p. 52), as ‘an illiterate man, ol bad character,
who had never taken a degree, but had been a common lawyer, thrust
into his see by a papal provision obtained lrom Pope Nieholas V by
the King's license, and now Margaret’s chancellor‚’ John Sutton, Lord
Dudley, and the abbot ol St. Peter's, Gloucester. Most ol the rest are
officers ol the household, and the petition further demands that such
persons among them as hold any office at court shall be discharged ol it,
and receive no wages lrom Dec. 1.

The King replied by his Chancellor, Stafford, who, if Gastoigne is to
be trusted (p. 231), was the most profligate churchman ol the day, that
he had olten declared to his Parliament that it was his intention to have
none but virtuous persons about him, and that he is not informed os any
cause why he should dispense with the services ol the persons named in
the petition. But he is willing that, with the exception os the lords and

answer seems to measure the alarm of the court. Next year, however,
to Gascoigne's infinite disgust, this ignorant lawyer and unworthy bishop
is promoted to the see ol York. It was more provoking and more scan-
dalous than the promotion os Sibthorp and Mainwaring by Charles 1.
The Parliament reenacted the Act ol Resumption, totidem verber,
and attainted Cade, not sor the original offence, but lor treasons alleged
to be committed by him from the 8th to the 11th ol July inclusive, in
Southwark, Dartlord, and Rochester. But not content with branding
the memory os the King's rebel, it sought to do the same by the public
enemy, Sullolk. The Commons petition the King that as Suffolk made

no valid and sufficient answer to the charges brought against him, a
