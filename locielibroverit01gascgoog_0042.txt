Gascoigne tells a curious story about the marriage ol Margaret
(pp. 190, 205, 219). He says that after Suffolk had negotiated the
marriage, he lost sight ol Margaret, and remained seventeen weeks in
France, without knowing where she was3 that subsequently he returned
to England and procured agrant from Parliament, and on returning to
France‚ found that Margaret was detained by the French King‚ wh0, on

rate, they sent envoys to the English Court, promising to revolt il they
were assisted by a competent force. Their offers were accepted, 3ηά the
old Earl ol Shrewsbury‚ who had risen toan earldom by his conduct in
the war ol the French succession, was made Lieutenant of Guienne on
September 3. There seemed to be a chance that the events os 1450
would be reversed, and on March 6, 1453, a Parliament was summoned,
in which Thomas Thorpe, one ol the officials ol the Exchequer, and six
