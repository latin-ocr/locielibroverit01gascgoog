by their curt answer to the Chancellor on March 13, when he informed
them that 2640900 was urgently 3ηά instantly wanted for the defence of
Calais 3ηά the marches which were in jeopardy. They flatly refused to
make any more granta reminding Kemp of an unfulfilled promise to
them, that public affairs should be directed by a ‘sad and wise council of
right discreet and wise lords and others!¹ The Commoris elected a new
Speaker‚ Sir Thos. Cherleton, and Thorpe remained in prison. No further
information is given as to the fate of Raleigh. Thorpe must have been
released soon afterwards. He was present next year at the affair of St.
Alban's, and does not appear to have been distinguished by personal
courage on that occasion. ,

The malady of the King continued. He had been moved to Windsor,
and some means had been taken for the conduct of ordinary business by
the appointment of the Duke of York to the function of presiding over
the Parliameut, now most unwontedly in the second year of its sitting.
But a crisis soon occurred. On March 22, Kemp, Archbishop of Canter-
bury and Lord Chaucellor, died suddenly. He had been nominated to
the archbishopric, Gascoigne tells us (p. 37), by Somerset, 3ηά had been

can be relied on, his neglect of duty during his long episcopate had been
uniformly scandalous. ‘For nearly twenty-eight years, during which he
was Archbishop of York, he was wholly absent from his diocese, residing
inLondon, or in Kent, or in other parts of England far away from his
diocese, except that once in ten or a dozen years he stayed there for two
or three weeks. ,He was seldom or never in York, and suffered his palace
to fall intodecay, for he never repaired it during the time he filled the see?

My readers will remember the manner in' which Macaulay dilates on
the llight of James from Whitehall, and the disappearance of the Great
Seal‚ which the King threw into the Thames. In the fifteenth century, the
continuous use of the Great Seal‚ always in the custody of the Chaucellor,
was even more important. It was absolutely necessary for the conduct of
business to fill the vacant office, 3ηά none but the King could appoint the
Chaucellor, Hitherto it appears that he had been in the Queen’s keeping,
and that no one had seen him since his malady had commenced, except
the members of his household. It was determined at once to appoint a
