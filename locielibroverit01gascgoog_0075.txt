consideration, marriages between very 'near kin. It frequently, l'or in·
stance, sanctioned a marriage between uncle and niece in the royal house
os Portugal. Beyond the doctrine that the action of the Pope must be
in accordance with the law ol God, I do not find that Gascoigne recog-
nises any control over the Pope in matters ol saith and doctrine. Still
his opinions on indulgences, and his statement that the Pope is liable to
err in matters os fact, isa large qualification.

But, whatever may be his reverence lor the Pope’s authority, and
however large he considers the Pope’s powers ol' government‚ especially
over the monastic orderS, he has no respect whatever sor the Pope’s court ’
and cardinals. ‘The Pope’ he says (p. 129), ‘is frequently constrained
by the excessive importunity ol' kings, lords, and officerS, os cardinals and
referendaries, to grant much which he does not judge either by Holy
Scripture or common reason ought to be granted, and what is not in
harmony with the divine judgment.' He gives a very dark picture ol their
conduct (p. 148) towards their master and the church. ‘Romanis innata
est cupiditas’ (p. 154), says Gascoigne, and goes on to tell how Prosper
Colonna rebelled against Eugenius IV, and tried to kill him, and how
the brother ol' this Cardinal had been enriched by his uncle with the
goods ol the church‚ how the Pope deposed Colonna, and deprived him
ol the archdeaconry ol Canterbury, which he held in commendam, and
how Archbishop Chichele seized the opportunity to put his nephew
Thomas Chichele into the vacant benefice. At last Eugenius yielded to
the importunity ol the Romans and his dread ol them, and restored
Prosper. But the archdeaconry ol Canterbury was gone, and Prosper
sued Thomas Chichele in the Roman curia, where it was finally agreed
that Prosper should have two English rectories in commendam worth
a hundred poundS, and yet this Prosper always went up to the English
who might be in the Roman court, saying, ‘You English, give me back
my benefice’ ‘This cardinal was appointed' says Gascoigne, ‘by his
uncle when he was only eighteen years‘old. I have heard,' he says
(p. 196), ‘that lately, inthe time ol a pope who died a lew years ago—he
probably means Eugenius-the Pope, worn out by the importunities and
entreaties oi those who profferred their petitions and expectant favours
(ie. provisions) written out in deeds, has said, “Since you tease and harass
me so, let what you want be done in the devil's name,” and soa deed was
